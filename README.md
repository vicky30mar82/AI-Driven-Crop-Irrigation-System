Reward Function:

Positive reward if soil moisture is optimal with minimal water usage
Negative reward for over-irrigation or under-irrigation
RL Algorithms:

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) ‚Äì if using a lightweight deep learning model
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) ‚Äì for continuous water flow control

Goal: Reduce power consumption and enable decision-making on low-power microcontrollers.
TinyML Use Cases:
Soil Moisture Prediction: Train a lightweight regression model using past soil moisture readings and environmental factors.
Anomaly Detection: Detect unusual changes in soil moisture (e.g., sudden dry patches).
Irrigation Decision: Use a trained RL model compressed using TensorFlow Lite to run on TinyML devices.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Cloud Connectivity & Data Logging
Why? To improve the RL model over time and allow remote monitoring.
